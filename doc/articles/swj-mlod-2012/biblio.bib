	Abstract = {{zesch,mueller,gurevych} (at) tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de Recently, collaboratively constructed resources such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary have been discovered as valuable lexical semantic knowledge bases with a high potential in diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Collaborative knowledge bases however significantly differ from traditional linguistic knowledge bases in various respects, and this constitutes both an asset and an impediment for research in NLP. This paper addresses one such major impediment, namely the lack of suitable programmatic access mechanisms to the knowledge stored in these large semantic knowledge bases. We present two application programming interfaces for Wikipedia and Wiktionary which are especially designed for mining the rich lexical semantic information dispersed in the knowledge bases, and provide efficient and structured access to the available knowledge. As we believe them to be of general interest to the NLP community, we have made them freely available for research purposes. 1.},

	Abstract = {With the rise of the Web 2.0, collaboratively constructed language
resources are rivalling expert-built lexicons. The collaborative
construction process of these resources is driven by what is called the
{\^a}€{\oe}Wisdom of Crowds{\^a}€ phenomenon, which offers very promising research
opportunities in the context of electronic lexicography. The vast number
and broad diversity of authors yield, for instance, quickly growing and
constantly updated resources. While expert-built lexicons have been
extensively studied in the past, there is yet a gap in researching
collaboratively constructed lexicons. We therefore provide a comprehensive
description of Wiktionary {\^a}€`` a freely available, collaborative online
lexicon. We study the variety of encoded lexical, semantic, and
cross-lingual knowledge of three different language editions of Wiktionary
and compare the coverage of terms, lexemes, word senses, domains, and
registers to multiple expert-built lexicons. We conclude our work by
discussing several findings and pointing out Wiktionary{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s future
directions and impact on lexicography.},

This article introduces a language-independent, semi-automatic and endogenous method for enriching lexical resources, based on collaborative editing and random walks through existing lexical relationships, and shows how this approach enables us to overcome recurrent impediments. It compares the impact of using different data sources and similarity measures on the task of improving synonymy networks. Finally, it defines an architecture for applying the presented method to Wiktionary and explains how it has been implemented.},
