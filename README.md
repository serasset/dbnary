# DBnary extractor #

DBnary is an attempt to extract as many lexical data as possible from Wiktionary language Edition as possible, in a structured (RDF) way, using standard lexicon ontology vocabulary (ontolex).

The extracted data is kept in sync with Wiktionary each time a new dump is generated and is available from http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary (more info is contained there).

### How can I use the extracted data? ###

Extracted data is available in RDF. You will have to load it in an RDF database or using an RDF API (Jena in Java or others in other languages...). You may download the data from the above web page.

You may also query the data from the above web page, using SPARQL.

This repository hosts the programs that extracted the dat from Wiktionary. It does not contain tools to use it.
